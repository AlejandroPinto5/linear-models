1. In Linear regression notebook is implemented a linear regression model to predict sales of a particular product at a particular outlet. The dataset is previosly cleaned.

2. We can use logistic regression to solve a classifcation problem. If you want to predict outome between two variables, we can use logistic regression. In logistic regresion notebook is implemented logistic regression on Titanic survival problem. Dataset gives us attribute of passengers who were traveling on the Titanic, so we need to predict wheter they would survived the tragedy ornot.
